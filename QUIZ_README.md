# Basic G.K. Quiz Project

This project aims to create a basic General Knowledge (G.K.) quiz application. It is designed to test the user's knowledge across various subjects and topics.

## Features

- Multiple-choice questions
- Instant feedback on answers
- Scoring system to track progress

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS for layout and styling
- JavaScript for interactivity

## Installation

To run this project locally, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
Click START THE QUIZ to begin.

## Project Structure

├── index.html

├── quiz.css

├── quiz.js

└── README.md

## How It Works

The quiz page initially displays a heading and a START THE QUIZ button.

The quiz form is hidden using CSS (display: none).

When the user clicks the start button:

The quiz form becomes visible

The first question and options are displayed

The button text changes to NEXT

Additional styling is applied to the button

## Sample Question Implemented

Question:
Who is known as the Missile Man of India?

Options:

Mahatma Gandhi

A. P. J. Abdul Kalam

Akshay Kumar

## Known Limitations

Only one question is implemented

No score calculation

No answer validation

No navigation between multiple questions

Radio buttons are not grouped using name attribute

HTML contains duplicated structure (to be cleaned up)

## Future Improvements that I will make

Add multiple questions using arrays or objects

Implement score tracking

Add answer validation and feedback

Improve UI and responsiveness

Fix HTML structure and semantics

Add quiz completion summary.

## Author

This project was created as a learning exercise to practice front-end web development concepts. I left it incomplete due to my upcoming exams but I will finish it in March after they end.
