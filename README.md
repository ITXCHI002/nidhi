Basic G.K. Quiz 🧠

Project Description:-

This is a simple Basic General Knowledge Quiz web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz displays a question with multiple-choice options and allows the user to start the quiz by clicking a button. The project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and styling using vanilla web technologies.

Note: This project is currently incomplete and represents an early-stage implementation.

Technologies Used:-

HTML5 – Structure of the quiz interface

CSS3 – Styling and layout

JavaScript (Vanilla) – Logic, event handling, and dynamic content updates

Features Implemented:-
* Start button to begin the quiz.

Dynamic display of:

* Question text

* Multiple-choice options

* Button text changes from START THE  QUIZ to NEXT

* Hidden form that appears after starting the quiz

* Responsive cursor interactions for buttons

Project Structure:-

├── index.html

├── quiz.css

├── quiz.js

└── README.md

How It Works:-
1. The quiz page initially displays a heading and a START THE QUIZ button.

2. The quiz form is hidden using CSS (display: none).

3. When the user clicks the start button:

The quiz form becomes visible

The first question and options are displayed

The button text changes to NEXT

4. Additional styling is applied to the button

Sample Question Implemented

Question:-
Who is known as the Missile Man of India?

Options:

i) Mahatma Gandhi

ii) A. P. J. Abdul Kalam

iii) Akshay Kumar

Known Limitations:-

* Only one question is implemented

* No score calculation

* No answer validation

* No navigation between multiple questions

* Radio buttons are not grouped using name attribute

Future Improvements that I am going to do:-

1. Add multiple questions using arrays or objects

2. Implement score tracking

3. Add answer validation and feedback

4. Improve UI and responsiveness

5. Fix HTML structure and semantics

6. Add quiz completion summary

How to Run:-

1. Download or clone the project files

2. Open index.html in any modern web browser

3. Click START THE QUIZ to begin

This project was created by me as a learning exercise to practice front-end web development concepts during my learning phase but had to stop due to exams. I will complete it after my exams end in march.
