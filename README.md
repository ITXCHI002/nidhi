Basic G.K. Quiz 🧠
Project Description
This is a simple Basic General Knowledge Quiz web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz displays a question with multiple-choice options and allows the user to start the quiz by clicking a button. The project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and styling using vanilla web technologies.

Note: This project is currently incomplete and represents an early-stage implementation.

The quiz form is hidden using CSS (display: none).

When the user clicks the start button:

The quiz form becomes visible

The first question and options are displayed

The button text changes to NEXT

Additional styling is applied to the button

Sample Question Implemented
