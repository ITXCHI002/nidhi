# Tic Tac Toe 

A simple **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This is a beginner-friendly project focused on learning DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic in JavaScript.

##  About the Game

- Two-player Tic Tac Toe game
- Players take turns marking **X** and **O**
- Turn order is controlled using a click counter
- Win and tie results are displayed on the screen

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the game board
- **CSS** – Styling and layout of the game
- **JavaScript** – Game logic and user interaction


## How It Works

- The game board consists of **9 buttons** arranged in a 3×3 grid
- Each click increases a counter:
  - Odd clicks → **X**
  - Even clicks → **O**
- After clicks, the game checks all possible winning combinations
- If a winning condition is met, "WINS" is displayed
- Otherwise, the game results in a "TIE".

## How to Run the Game

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser
3. Click on the squares to start playing

No installation or setup required ✅

## Current Limitations

- Players can overwrite already clicked cells
- No restart/reset button
- Win message does not specify which player won
- Tie logic runs even if the game is still in progress

Possible Future Improvements I am going to do:-

- Prevent clicking on already selected cells
- Display which player (X or O) wins
- Add a reset/restart button
- Improve win/tie detection logic
- Add better UI styling and animations
